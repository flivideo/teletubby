/**
 * THE ZONE MODEL — requirements §1 and §2.
 *
 * The talent chooses which zones are on screen. The app has no fixed layout and
 * no default it defends, because "adding a mode the talent has to learn fails
 * the test; adding an arrangement they can choose does not."
 *
 * Two rules the zones must ALWAYS obey, and both are structural here rather
 * than something a component remembers to do:
 *
 *   1. **Zones stay aligned.** Everything on screen derives from ONE number —
 *      `step`, the index into the active trigger set. The paragraph, the minor
 *      topic and the major topic are all looked up from that trigger's authored
 *      paragraph id. There is no second cursor that could drift out of step. A
 *      zone that drifts is worse than a zone that is absent, because it is
 *      believed.
 *
 *   2. **One strong marker, ever.** The driven zone carries it; every follower
 *      gets the quiet one. Two equally-loud markers read as two competing
 *      claims about where you are (prior-art §5).
 */

/**
 * ⚠️ **TRIGGERS AS A ZONE — a stated assumption, not a ruling.**
 *
 * requirements §1 lists four zones: major topic · minor topic · paragraph ·
 * full transcript. **Triggers are not in that list** — yet the North Star says
 * "column 2 is the product" and §5 makes the three trigger styles the whole
 * experiment. Those two passages came from different conversations and were
 * never reconciled.
 *
 * Read literally, the zone model deletes the product. So triggers are modelled
 * here as a fifth zone and a member of the recording set. If that is wrong, the
 * fix is one line in `RECORDING_SET` — nothing else in this file assumes it.
