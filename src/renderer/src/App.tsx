      {/* ---------------- the drag rail ----------------

          The narrowest top band this window can have, and it is measured, not
          guessed. `titleBarStyle: 'hiddenInset'` makes macOS float the traffic
          lights over the page whether or not the page draws anything up here.

          ⚠️ MEASURE THEM ON A FOCUSED WINDOW. Unfocused, the buttons render as
          faint grey discs that a colour threshold clips at the edges — that is
          how this rail first shipped at 24px with the lights spilling 1.5px
          past the border. Focused, they are chromatic and span logical
          y 13.0-24.5. The floor is 25px; the rail is 28px, which leaves 3.5px
          under them.

          Below the floor needs `setWindowButtonVisibility(false)` from the main
          process, which is a real option and deliberately not taken: losing
          close and minimise to the mouse is a bigger surprise than 0.7cm is a
          win, and there is nothing this band is competing with.

          ⚠️ THIS IS THE ONLY DRAG REGION THE WINDOW HAS. `hiddenInset` means
          the page supplies it or the window cannot be moved at all, and nothing
          can collapse it away. The title is the ONE clickable thing in it
          (`.tt-no-drag`, click-to-copy) — it carves its own width out of the
          drag area and no more, and everything right of the title still drags.
          Anything else that wants a click up here is a conversation first.

          It carries ONE thing: the script title. Reviewing script 06 from the
          chair, the title in the footer strip (14px, bottom-left) was
          unreadable, and "which script am I on" is a glance at the start of a
          take, not a thing read mid-take. 18px fits inside the 28px with zero
          growth — the lights only occupy x 0–78 and the rest of the band was
          empty. It is muted so it never competes with the driven marker, and
          the rail sits outside `.tt-mirror` so it stays readable on glass.
          Ruled 2026-08-30. Do NOT grow `h-7` for a bigger title.

            ⚠️ It sits OUTSIDE `.tt-mirror` on purpose. Mirror mode flips the
            stage for prompter glass; chrome must stay readable, and a mirrored
            control panel is unusable.

            ⚠️ Nothing here writes `weights`. The lanes narrow because a sibling
            took width and they spring back when it closes — lane widths are a
            saved rig property, and a panel that rebalanced them would rewrite

          It used to be at the top, and being at the top was the whole problem:
          the camera sits ABOVE the screen, so a strip up there is not merely
          chrome, it is centimetres of distance between the lens and the first
          word. Down here it costs the talent nothing — nobody's eyes travel
          BELOW the script on their way to the camera.

          It carries only what changes DURING a take: where you are, which
          corpus, which style, Cadence, and the way in to Setup. Everything that
          BUILDS an arrangement is still behind S.

          This is also what dissolved the tension in the reclaimed state. When
          the strip lived at the top, reclaiming the band meant hiding it, which
          meant putting corpus and style behind a gesture — the exact thing that
          nearly disqualified the setup panel. At the foot there is nothing to
          hide: reclaim takes the lane chrome and the reading line, and the two
          axes of the A/B/C experiment stay on screen and stay live. */}
