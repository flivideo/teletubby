/**
 * THE DOMAIN — the shapes Teletubby actually deals in.
 *
 * ⚠️ **No runtime dependencies, deliberately.** The renderer imports this file,
 * and the renderer cannot carry a validation library: `@appydave/core` reaches
 * `node:fs` through its config loader, which does not exist in a browser
 * context and fails at bundle time rather than at runtime. The Zod schemas that
 * used to live here are in `domain-schema.ts`, imported only by the core in the
 * main process — which is also where writes are actually validated.
 *
 * This file is a contract, not an artifact of a generator. `scripts.ts` carries
 * types too, but those were whatever one build script happened to emit; three
 * things were wrong with them and each one blocks a later session:
 *
 *   1. There was ONE heading level. Requirements §1 needs a major topic AND a
 *      minor topic, because the zone model selects between them.
 *   2. The trigger→paragraph map sat on the SCRIPT. With three trigger styles
 *      per transcript, each style has its own step count and therefore its own
 *      map. The map belongs to the trigger set (requirements §5).
 *   3. Corpus was not modelled at all. Tom's originals and the re-cadenced
 *      rewrites are different corpora of the same script and both must be
 *      loadable and switchable (requirements open item 9).
 *
 * Talent is first-class for the reason requirements §7 and §9 give: the cadence
 * envelope is a MEASUREMENT OF ONE PERSON and must never be ported between
 * talents. Modelling it as a global constant is how that rule gets broken.
 *
 * Nothing here imports Electron, node:fs, or a transport. The core, the tests,
 * the build script and every adapter share these shapes.
