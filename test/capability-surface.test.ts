/**
 * THE PINNED SURFACE.
 *
 * "If you build one enforcement thing, build this" — agent-safety.md §8. A
 * single test asserting the exact set of externally-published capabilities.
 * Adding a verb fails CI until someone states the intent, which is stronger
 * than a PR checklist because it cannot be skipped by a tired reviewer.
 *
 * ImageDrip added the same test after finding a hole and it immediately caught
 * four more channels that were "safe" only because nothing had registered a
 * handler for them yet.
 *
 * **If a change here fails, do not update the list to make it pass.** Read the
 * safety gate in `docs/spec.md` first and decide, deliberately, that the new
 * verb belongs on the surface it claims.
