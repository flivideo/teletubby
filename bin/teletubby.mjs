/**
 * `teletubby` — a thin CLI over the running app's control surface.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY STUPID. Every command is a `fetch()` against
 * http://127.0.0.1:7111; there is no business logic in this file and there
 * never should be. Open Design's CLI is 10,394 lines and holds none either —
 * that is what makes it impossible for the CLI and the UI to drift apart.
 *
 * What it is NOT: a second way to do things. If a verb is missing here it is
 * missing from the capability catalog, and that is where to add it.
 *
 *   teletubby health
 *   teletubby capabilities
 *   teletubby call get_set
 *   teletubby call get_script --input '{"scriptId":"kybernesis-phase-1/01"}'
 *   teletubby call score_transcript --input '{"scriptId":"…","transcriptId":"v01-rewrite","talentId":"david"}'
 *
 * The app must be running. That is inherent, not a defect — the control surface
 * lives inside the window's process, and the health route says so plainly
 * rather than letting a caller guess.

  health                       Is the app up? (no token needed)
  capabilities                 Every verb this surface exposes, with its contract
  call <capability> [--input <json>] [--idempotency-key <key>] [--as agent:<name>]

  The same surface over JSON-RPC 2.0 (family.verb names, e.g. script.write):
    POST /api/rpc · spec GET /api/openrpc.json · reference GET /api/docs
    console (pick a verb, fire it as agent:console) GET /api/console

  Input ALWAYS goes in --input. A bare JSON positional is refused, not ignored.
    teletubby call get_script --input '{"scriptId":"kybernesis-phase-1/01"}'

  "capabilities" is the authority on what exists AND how to call it — every
  verb publishes its input fields (name, type, required, default, note),
  derived from the same zod schema the gate validates with. Compose calls
  from that; a verb that takes nothing publishes input: [].

Environment:
  TELETUBBY_URL           default http://127.0.0.1:${DEFAULT_PORT}
  TELETUBBY_TOKEN         default: read from the running app's control.json
  TELETUBBY_CONTROL_FILE  where to find that file
  TELETUBBY_AS            who you are (default cli); --as wins
